Enhanced Project Concept: Narraviz (Data → Narrative → Visualization)

A web platform where users can upload datasets (CSV/JSON) or connect APIs, and the system transforms them into interactive, animated data stories with charts, text explanations, and transitions (like a mix of Tableau Public + Datawrapper + Prezi animations).

🎯 Core Features (MVP → Advanced)
MVP

Dataset Upload & API Integration

Upload CSV/JSON files.

Connect to APIs (e.g., stock market, COVID data, weather).

Backend parses data and provides structured schema to frontend.

Chart Builder

Drag-and-drop chart types (bar, line, pie, scatter, maps).

D3.js/Recharts integration for rendering.

Custom color palettes + Tailwind themes.

Story Mode (Presentation Flow)

Define “slides” (each slide = chart + annotations + transition).

GSAP-powered animations between slides.

Autoplay mode → charts animate step by step.

Export & Share

Shareable public link.

Option to export as interactive HTML or static PDF (with charts as images).

Advanced (to make it stand out)

AI Insights (Optional)

Integrate an LLM to automatically generate text insights:
“Revenue increased by 23% in Q2 compared to Q1.”

NLP on dataset → highlight key trends.

Collaboration & Commenting

Users can invite teammates to co-edit stories.

Comment system like Google Docs for feedback on slides.

Interactive Maps

GeoJSON + Mapbox integration for location-based data stories.

Template Library

Pre-built storytelling templates (e.g., “Financial Report,” “Health Dashboard,” “Startup Metrics”).

🏗️ Tech Stack Breakdown
Frontend

Next.js + TypeScript → SEO-friendly, SSR/SSG.

D3.js for complex visualizations (or Recharts for simpler use cases).

GSAP for animations (chart reveal, transitions, scrolling effects).

Tailwind CSS for rapid, responsive UI design.

Framer Motion (optional) for UI-level transitions between pages/components.

Backend

Node.js + Express → dataset ingestion, parsing, API connectors.

Papaparse (CSV parsing) or fast-csv.

Prisma + PostgreSQL → store user stories, datasets, and slides.

Socket.IO/WebSockets → real-time collaboration (if implemented).

Deployment

Frontend → Vercel/Netlify.

Backend + DB → Railway / Fly.io / Supabase.

🎨 Example User Flow

User uploads COVID-19 dataset (CSV).

App detects columns: date, cases, deaths, region.

User selects Line Chart → Cases over Time.

Adds text annotation: “Sharp increase during March 2020 lockdown.”

Creates Slide 2: Map Chart showing cases per country.

Exports story → Interactive link with GSAP animations (charts fade/slide in, values animate).

✨ Why Employers Will Love It

Demonstrates full-stack skills → data parsing backend + animated, interactive frontend.

Complex UI/UX → not just CRUD, but storytelling, transitions, and data viz.

Industry relevance → data visualization is hot in SaaS, fintech, analytics, and healthtech.

Product thinking → you’re building something that feels like a real startup MVP.

📅 Suggested Build Roadmap
Phase 1 (2–3 weeks)

Next.js + Tailwind base project.

CSV upload & parsing (backend).

Render first charts (bar, line) with Recharts.

Phase 2 (2–4 weeks)

Add Story Mode (multi-step slides).

GSAP animations between slides.

Export story as sharable link.

Phase 3 (Optional Advanced)

AI-generated insights.

Collaborative editing.

Template library.

👉 On GitHub, include:

Live demo link (Vercel).

GIFs/screenshots of animations in README.

Tech highlights clearly listed.

Short demo dataset preloaded (e.g., World Bank GDP data).

Pages (Phase 1 MVP)

Landing Page (/)

Hero section (project name + CTA).

Short explanation: “Turn your datasets into animated stories.”

Buttons: “Try Demo” / “Login”.

Dashboard (/dashboard)

Sidebar navigation: Datasets | Stories | Editor.

Overview of uploaded datasets and stories.

Datasets (/dashboard/datasets)

Upload CSV/JSON.

List of uploaded datasets.

Stories (/dashboard/stories)

List of created stories.

“Create New Story” button.

Editor (/dashboard/editor)

Core feature: select dataset → build charts.

Add text annotations + define slides (basic UI in Phase 1).

🎨 Design System (Clean, Professional, Modern)

Style Goal: Think Notion + Datawrapper + Apple — minimal, elegant, data-focused.

Font Pairing:

Headings: Inter Bold (modern, geometric)

Body: Inter Regular or Source Sans Pro (readable)

Color Palette (Light Mode)

Background: #F9FAFB (light gray)

Text Primary: #111827 (near black)

Text Secondary: #6B7280 (neutral gray)

Accent: #2563EB (blue) → CTAs, highlights

Secondary Accent: #10B981 (emerald green) → success/positive metrics

Danger: #EF4444 (red) → errors/warnings

Dark Mode (optional later)

Background: #111827

Text Primary: #F9FAFB

Accent: #3B82F6 (lighter blue)

UI Vibe:

Rounded corners (rounded-2xl)

Soft shadows (shadow-lg)

Subtle animations with Framer Motion + GSAP

🚦 Phase 1 — Build Plan
Week 1

Setup Project

Init Next.js 14 with TypeScript, Tailwind, shadcn/ui.

Add ESLint + Prettier.

Configure project structure.

Landing Page

Build marketing page with CTA + demo dataset link.

Week 2

Dashboard Shell

Layout with sidebar + top nav.

Pages: Datasets, Stories, Editor (stub).

Dataset Upload

Use Papaparse for CSV upload + parsing.

Store dataset in memory (Phase 1 → no DB yet).

Basic Chart Rendering

Load sample dataset into Recharts.

Display bar/line chart.

Week 3

Story Mode (Basic)

Allow user to create a story with 2–3 slides.

Each slide = chart + text annotation.

Simple GSAP transition (fade in/out).

Export/Share (Phase 1 MVP)

Generate a public sharable link (just local route for now).
